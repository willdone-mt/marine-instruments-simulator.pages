# 🐳 About the Project

Sirenia is a simulator software focusing on replicating the operation of marine scientific instruments in real-life field.
[WIP]
This software also planned to be able to open third-party software such as the instrument's launcher and data pre-processing software.
I intended to make it as an warmer up before student/user handling the real fragile instrument, or at least as a introduction or lesson to teach when there is no available real-life instrument.
