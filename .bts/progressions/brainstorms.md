# BRAINSTORMS

# Software Programming Goal

### MAIN GOAL  
Sirenia will be a simulator software focusing on replicating the operation of marine scientific instruments in real-life field.

### General Goal

### Specific Goal
will be clear after map and chart all the feature and stage it

# Software's Scopes

What the software surely doesnt do:

- Giving a (complete) information about the instruments
- Giving a (complete) instruction about running the instruments's instruction launcher and data pre-and-processing

What the software probably would do:

- Give a basic "prinsip kerja" of the instrument
- Link to the instrument's complete information and specification
- Giving a hint instruction and link to operate the instruments
- Giving a 3D visualization of the instruments
- Giving a basic comprehensive lesson about marine and related equations, and link to it's complete information

# Programming Language to Use
Possible and Considerable programming language to use

- **Python** (data and game dev)  
- **C++** (data and game dev)  
- **HTML** (frontend)  
- **JavaScript** (backend)  

Reconsidering language

- **CSS** (after certain amount of progress: helping HTML)
- **Java** (after all done with the main language)

# Targeted Instruments

at least 2 easy instruments and 1 complex instruments for alpha test

## Initial instruments

initial instruments must be: easy to operate, deploy, and processed as well as commonly known by students

- Refractometer???
- WQC
- CTD ... 

## Planned Late Instruments

- CTDs
  - SBEs
- Hidrophones

# Software name
- **Marlin**  
  "Only the worthy can catch a Marlin"
- **Manta**
- **Sirenia**

# Planned Aspects
- Targeted Audience:
  
  College Students, especially in marine science, globally

  (needs to be open-access aka free, but still closed source)
  (needs a easy non-complex instant instalation)
  (needs sites to open issues)

- How long the software is useful

  Forever?  
  Maintanance will mostly not happen daily nor monthly, maybe bimonthly. Will probably host potential worthy developer after certain amount of time

# Plug and Play kinda Instrument Packages

planning to have a instruments as packages.
possible "cable" that would be needed for:

- sensor input (inputing virtual data to sensor)
  - \+ instrument's UI 
- data output (instrument's output)
- instruction input

# Readmes
- Sirenia will be a simulator software focusing on replicating the operation of marine scientific instruments in real-life field.
- This software also planned to be able to open third-party software such as the instrument's launcher and data pre-processing software.
- I intended to make it as an warmer up before student/user handling the real fragile instrument, or at least as a introduction or lesson to teach when there is no available real-life instrument.
- [WIP] certainly will not 100% accurate. needs a more senior instructor or assistant

# Permissions
- Make permissions for possible developers
- application is open-access/free, but the source code is closed
