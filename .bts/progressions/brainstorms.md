# Software's Scopes

What the software surely doesnt do:
- Giving a (complete) information about the instruments
- Giving a (complete) instruction about running the instruments's instruction launcher and data pre-and-processing

What the software probably would do:
- Link to the instrument's complete information and specification
- Giving a hint instruction and link to operate the instruments
- Giving a 3D visualization of the instruments
- Giving a basic comprehensive lesson about marine and related equations, and link to it's complete information
